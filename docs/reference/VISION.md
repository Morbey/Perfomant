# Performant: Long-Term Vision

Performant aims to evolve into a self-improving ecosystem of agents capable of learning workflows, optimising repetitive processes and acting as an intelligent automation layer across organisations. The system should scale from individual use to multi-department automation without compromising privacy.

A central pillar of this vision is schema-driven reasoning: tools and agents exchange concise, structured summaries rather than unbounded raw text. This enables predictable behaviour, low token costs, easier debugging, and safer decision-making. As modules mature, Performant will expand into decision support, anomaly detection, workflow generation, multi-agent collaboration, auditing, and predictive analytics.

The long-term goal is a reliable automation infrastructure powered by transparent, modular agents that communicate through shared schemas and well-defined contracts, rather than ad hoc prompts and unstructured context.
